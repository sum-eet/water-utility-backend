### Rationale for the Utility Score Calculation

The scoring system is designed to provide a standardized measure of water utility performance based on the available data, considering critical health and safety factors. The score is calculated as a percentage, normalized to a range from 0 to 100, making it easily interpretable and comparable across utilities.

#### Key Factors in the Score Calculation:

1. **Severity of Contaminants:**
   - Certain contaminants pose a higher health risk. For example, contaminants linked to cancer are given a higher severity score compared to less harmful substances. This prioritizes public health impacts in the scoring system.

2. **Frequency and Magnitude of Violations:**
   - The "Times Above Guideline" metric is used to quantify how much a utility exceeds recommended safety levels for detected contaminants. The higher the frequency or magnitude, the more it negatively impacts the utility's score.

3. **Average Utility Level:**
   - The "Utility Level" indicates the concentration of contaminants present. Utilities with lower average levels of contaminants score better, reflecting safer water quality.

4. **Number of Contaminants Detected:**
   - The total number of different contaminants detected in a utilityâ€™s water supply also affects the score. More contaminants typically indicate poorer water quality.

5. **Data Completeness and Transparency:**
   - Utilities with more comprehensive and clear reporting of contaminant data are indirectly favored, as this contributes to more accurate scoring.

#### Formula for Score Calculation:
The score combines these factors with appropriate weightings:

\[
\text{Score} = 40\% \times \text{Severity Score} + 40\% \times \text{Average Times Above Guideline} + 20\% \times \text{Average Utility Level}
\]

Each component is normalized to ensure consistent scaling. The score is capped at 100 to maintain interpretability and fairness.

#### Why This Approach?
This scoring system provides a balanced assessment of a utility's performance. It highlights the health risks posed by contaminants while factoring in their concentration and frequency. Normalization ensures comparability, making it easier for users to identify high-performing utilities and those that may need attention or intervention.

#### Use Case:
In this specific case (utility selected from the table), the score reflects:
- The presence of contaminants with significant potential health effects.
- The degree to which the utility's water quality exceeds safety guidelines.
- The overall average levels of contaminants, indicating water purity.

This rationale ensures that the score is both meaningful and actionable for stakeholders, from consumers to regulatory bodies.
